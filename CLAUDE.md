# REAL ESTATE ANALYZER - PROJECT GUIDE

## Project Overview
The Real Estate Flip Analyzer is a comprehensive tool for evaluating residential property flip investments. It provides data-driven investment analysis through web scraping, comparable property assessment, and AI-powered insights to help investors make informed decisions.

## Project Goals
1. Automate real estate flip investment analysis with accurate financial projections
2. Gather market data through web scraping for comparable properties
3. Calculate After Repair Value (ARV) based on comparable property analysis
4. Provide risk assessment and confidence scoring for investment decisions
5. Generate professional reports with AI-powered insights
6. Offer a user-friendly CLI experience for property investors

## Development Commands
- Start application: `npm start`
- Development mode: `npm run dev`
- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Run single test: `npx jest path/to/test.js`
- Test puppeteer: `node test-puppeteer.js`
- Run demo: `node final-demo.js`

## Architecture
- **Models** (`src/models/`): Data structures for properties and analysis results
- **API clients** (`src/api/`): Interface with external APIs (Claude, OpenAI, ATTOM)
- **Web scraping** (`src/web/`): Property data collection from websites
- **Utilities** (`src/utils/`): Analysis algorithms and export functionality
- **Tests** (`tests/`): Unit tests for core components
- **Data storage** (`data/`): Output files for reports and analysis results

## Core Features
1. **Property Data Collection**: Input forms and web scraping for property information
2. **Comparable Property Analysis**: Find and validate similar properties for valuation
3. **Investment Metrics**: Calculate ARV, ROI, profit projections, and equity creation
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate investment risks with confidence scoring
5. **AI Insights**: Generate investment recommendations using Claude/OpenAI
6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Export analysis in multiple formats (Excel, JSON, HTML, AI-generated)

## Code Style
- **Imports**: Group by type (built-in, external, internal) with blank line separating groups
- **Classes**: Class and filenames use PascalCase (PropertyData, ComparableProperty)
- **Variables/Functions**: Use camelCase, descriptive names (calculateArvFromComps)
- **Error handling**: Use try/catch blocks with specific error messages
- **Async code**: Use async/await pattern, avoid nested callbacks
- **Documentation**: JSDoc style comments for all functions/methods
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Testing**: Jest for unit testing core functionality
